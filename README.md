I made another version of the game! I added some sprites to the snake in order to make the snake look more beautiful... I also added a new texture to the apple, a new display for the screen and also a menu for the game... the game now is smooth and more difficult... now I'm learning databases so that I can add a CO-OP or MULTIPLAYER mode to the game. Soooo I will not share the code for now cuz I still need more time to keep learning databases and then do what I have to do and then I pretend to update some lines of code (for the screen's display and modify the sprites of the snake). See ya!
